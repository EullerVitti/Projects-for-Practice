This was another experimentation using the pyautogui library.
I was at a very busy period and needed to download hundreds of videos from a platform of programming courses.
So an easy and fast solution (not the most efficient) was to have this script download all the lessons and name them in numerical ordem for me. 
There is an .mp4 file showing it as it runs

PS: it is totally legal to download their videos. But since there wasn't a quick option to download entire courses, I used this script instead.
