This Python script scrapes news articles from the Hacker News website and prints out the titles, links, and votes for articles with more than 99 points. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    Imports:
        requests: Used for making HTTP requests.
        sys: Used for handling command-line arguments.
        BeautifulSoup from bs4: A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
        pprint: Pretty-printing for easier readability of data structures.

    sort_stories_by_votes function:
        Takes a list of dictionaries (hnlist) representing articles.
        Sorts the list of articles by the number of votes in descending order.
        Returns the sorted list.

    create_custom_hn function:
        Takes two lists (links and subtext) representing the titles/links and subtext of articles.
        Iterates over the articles, extracting title, link, and votes.
        Filters articles with less than or equal to 99 votes.
        Returns a sorted list of dictionaries using sort_stories_by_votes.

    Initialization:
        res: An empty list to store the URLs for each page.
        url: The base URL for Hacker News.
        num_pg: The number of pages to scrape, taken from the command-line argument.

    Page URL Generation:
        Generates a list of URLs for each page to be scraped based on the specified number of pages.

    Scraping Loop:
        For each URL in res, it sends a request to Hacker News, parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the titles and subtext of articles.
        If there are more than one page (num_pg > 1), it iterates over the remaining pages, appends the titles and subtext to the existing lists.

    Print Results:
        Calls create_custom_hn with the collected titles and subtext.
        Prints the result using pprint.

This script essentially collects and displays information about Hacker News articles, filtering for those with more than 99 votes, and is capable of scraping multiple pages if specified in the command-line argument.
